# flutterCounter
A basic flutter app that lets user to do count

This is built as a continuation of the sample app.  It originally use FloatingActionButton for increment, but the app only allows 1 FloatingAction button.  Therefore, the code is changed to raisedButton to support for more buttons.

The code had been modified to add a decrement counter so one can also decrement the counter.
